## About

This repository contains C++ source code of many WTL based classes that I wrote and that are shared through many of my projects.

It also contains a copy of the WTL library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/), note that this copy is customized and subject to minor changes, it is not supposed to always be the original WTL source.
